models should have a mirrored schema

# - make sure all data is validated
# - check to make sure only changed data is persisted
# - embedded objects (references)
# - embedded objects (simple)
# - primitive collections
# - virtual methods
# - virtual properties
# - collections
# - persisting
# - ability to self reference owner
# - default values
# - collections which are persisted to a model - not v model
